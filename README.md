Introduction to SQL
Joining Data in SQL
Intermediate SQL

QUESTIONS:
1. What range of years does the provided database cover?

2. Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did 
he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?

3. Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list 
showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the 
major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which 
Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

4. Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the 
numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you 
see any trends?

5. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is 
measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen 
base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only 
players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases.

6. Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks 
which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016 (where average attendance is 
defined as total attendance divided by number of games). Only consider parks where 
there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name, team name, and average 
attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.


Open-ended questions: Feel free to use SQL, Python, and/or Excel to answer questions. 
Group 1: Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data from 
2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, keep in mind that salaries across 
the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a year-by-year basis.
